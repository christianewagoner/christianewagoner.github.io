                    <p>Welcome to my online portfolio! As of June 2019, I am a Store Manager at the flagship store of Shoe Carnival Inc., one of the top footwear retailers in the United States. Simply put I oversee the day to day operations of an $11 million shoe store. The best part of my job is being a part of and leading a team effort and trying to achieve our goals <em>together.</em> </p>
                    
                    <p>I obtained my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Information Systems from the University of Southern Indiana in December of 2016. It was during my senior year there that I discovered I had a passion for coding during an SQL class. </p>
                    
                    <p>My passion for coding accelerated after college when I learned HTML5 and CSS. This passion has accelerated so much I have decided to learn more languages and gear myself up for a change in careers from retail manager to web developer (See "Future Goals" section for more details). In my free time, I love to harness my skills by working on my own projects and looking for new and creative web design features and schemes.</p>

                <h3>Passion For Learning</h3>
                <p class="content-what">Learning is my biggest passion. I believe learning creates more new experiences than anything else. Learning is about perserverance, stepping out of comfort zones, and pushing limits. Learning creates new opportunities and new interactions. But learning means next to nothing unless its shared. Web development gives me the opportunity to share what I've learned and that's why I'm drawn to it.</p>
